## Installation

It requires express.js, mysql2, inquirer, and console.table installed. 

## Usage

To use employee tracker, run node index.js. You will then be presented with a series of choices to choose from after a prompt. When the user selects a choice they will be presented with a table of the information from that choice. This data is created by quering the tables in the employee_db database. The choices can be updated with options and corresponding queries to make the application include table outputs for other views.
